## TOPICS
### ReactJS - Hospital Application
ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript framework for building a user interface. A uniqueness of ReactJS is that it is not restricted to just client-side programming, but can also be used for the server-side. This case study is about creating a hospital application to sign in, signup, add, view, and edit the patient details, book, view, and edit appointment details, and so on.

In this application, you will do the following :

  * Create a signup page to register the user.
  * Create a sign-in page to login to the application if the credentials are correct.
  * Create components to Register, Edit, and View patient details.
  * Create components to Book, Edit, and View the appointments.
  * Create a Navbar.
 
01 You need to follow these steps otherwise you will face some server issues even hands-On code is right. 

    Step 1: Run ---- Install
    Step 2: Run ---- Run
    Step 3: Run ---- Tests 
    
02 Do this steps before pasting code after Run Tests to check the test cases passed

## PRE-REQUISITES
HTML, CSS, JS, and ReactJS
